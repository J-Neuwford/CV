I am a motivated and ambitous full stack software developer, looking for a role in which I can further develop my existing programming skills and work on exciting and challenging projects, with a view to apply my extensive management and EQ experience to have a postive impact on the team I join.

After acheiving my goal of becoming a manager at the LUSH global flagship store, I took the opportunity to take on large recruitment projects and transform the way in which recuitment was managed to become more inclusive and attract the best talent for the business. With over 70 additional team members we then went on to secure the largest increase in sales of any LUSH store in the UK. I then left my job and learned to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, and have transformed my career to find success as a software developer.

Tech Skills: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Ruby, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, TDD

## Skills
  - **Creative thinking** - I focus on understanding things enough so that I can express my ideas and apply my creativity. When that happens I really enjoy finding interesting abstractions that not only enable quick understanding, but ensures that the codebase can grow whilst maintaining cohesion.
  - **EQ** - I pride myself on my ability to create and maintain great working relationships in a safe environment.
  - **Motivation** - I'm able to consistently keep myself positive and focussed. Motivating others was my favourite aspect of my time in management.
  - **Passion for learning** - I take ownership of my own development, and I love taking on new challenges.
  - **Critical thinking** - I love finding solutions to tricky problems. Starting with an ambiguous task that has no fixed solution is when I thrive the most.
